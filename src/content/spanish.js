I am particularly interested in how the different areas that make up an organization interact together and in working at those intersections, so I was grateful for a work environment where I had to sync up with my team every week and learn about what else was going on . And not just what my coworkers were doing but also what obstacles they were coming up against, which I think makes for more solid teamwork. That’s really not something most people get to experience in a society where work is mostly specialized into separate departments.',

In seven weeks, I learned more about backend development and product management than I would have learned in an entire semester in college. The projects were quite challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. The high level of autonomy and personal responsibility provided a strong sense of ownership for my work, which I found crucial to my growth and success. I would recommend this program to anyone looking to level up their professional skills in a fun an engaging learning environment.',
